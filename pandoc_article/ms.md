# Introduction

Hello, this is my next article. Here is a citation [@Mattar:2005].

# Methods

Here is an equation:

\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
\label{eq:linear}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:linear} is the linear regression equation.

# Results

I don't really have any yet. Figure \ref{fig:cat} shows a picture of a cat.

# Discussion

What would you like me to discuss? I could talk about how nice it is that pandoc can use .csl styles to generate bibliographies, there are lots of them here:
